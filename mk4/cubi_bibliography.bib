  abstract = {Despite the success of biological therapies in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), patient management remains challenging due to a lack of therapy response predictors. Here we prospectively sampled two cohorts of IBD patient cohorts receiving the anti-integrin α4β7 antibody vedolizumab. Samples were subjected to mass cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell V(D)J sequencing, serum proteomics, and multidimensional flow cytometry to comprehensively assess vedolizumab-induced immunological changes in the peripheral blood and their potential associations with treatment response. Vedolizumab induced changes in the abundance of both circulating innate and adaptive immune cell compartments and modified the T cell receptor diversity of circulating gut-homing CD4+ memory T cells. Through integration of multimodal parameters and machine learning, we identify that pretreatment activated proliferating CD4+ memory T cell abundance is associated with treatment failure, independent of clinical variables, thereby providing a reliable predictive classifier with significant implications for the personalized management of IBD patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {The last decade witnesses the emergence of the abundant family of smORF peptides, encoded by small ORF (<100 codons), whose biological functions remain largely unexplored. Bioinformatic analyses here identify hundreds of putative smORF peptides expressed in Drosophila imaginal leg discs. Thanks to a functional screen in leg, we found smORF peptides involved in morphogenesis, including the pioneer smORF peptides Pri. Since we identified its target Ubr3 in the epidermis and pri was known to control leg development through poorly understood mechanisms, we investigated the role of Ubr3 in mediating pri function in leg. We found that pri plays several roles during leg development both in patterning and in cell survival. During larval stage, pri activates independently of Ubr3 tarsal transcriptional programs and Notch and EGFR signaling pathways, whereas at larval pupal transition, Pri peptides cooperate with Ubr3 to insure cell survival and leg morphogenesis. Our results highlight Ubr3 dependent and independent functions of Pri peptides and their pleiotropy. Moreover, we reveal that the smORF peptide family is a reservoir of overlooked developmental regulators, displaying distinct molecular functions and orchestrating leg development.},

  abstract = {Increasing evidence points toward epigenetic variants as a risk factor for developing obesity. We analyzed DNA methylation of the POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin) gene, which is pivotal for satiety regulation. We identified sex-specific and nongenetically determined POMC hypermethylation associated with a 1.4-fold (confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.04) increased individual risk of developing obesity. To investigate the early embryonic establishment of POMC methylation states, we established a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) model. Here, hESCs (WA01) were transferred into a naïve state, which was associated with a reduction of DNA methylation. Naïve hESCs were differentiated via a formative state into POMC-expressing hypothalamic neurons, which was accompanied by re-establishment of DNA methylation patterning. We observed that reduced POMC gene expression was associated with increased POMC methylation in POMC-expressing neurons. On the basis of these findings, we treated POMC-hypermethylated obese individuals (n = 5) with an MC4R agonist and observed a body weight reduction of 4.66 ± 2.16% (means ± SD) over a mean treatment duration of 38.4 ± 26.0 weeks. In summary, we identified an epigenetic obesity risk variant at the POMC gene fulfilling the criteria for a metastable epiallele established in early embryonic development that may be addressable by MC4R agonist treatment to reduce body weight. Early-set and nongenetically determined POMC methylation variability is associated with altered gene function and increased obesity risk. The protein proopiomelanocortin (POMC) helps regulate satiety and energy expenditure via leptin-melanocortin signaling. Lechner et al. show that epigenetic modification of the POMC gene carries increased risk of obesity, particularly in females. Augmenting melanocortin signaling via administration of the melanocortin 4 receptor agonist setmelanotide in five individuals with non-genetic obesity plus POMC hypermethylation resulted in an average weight loss of 4.6%. DNA methylation was increased in hypothalamic neurons differentiated from their less-methylated naïve human embryonic stem cell precursors, suggesting that nongenetic POMC hypermethylation may be established during development in humans. —Catherine Charneski},

  abstract = {Human-based organ models can provide strong predictive value to investigate the tropism, virulence, and replication kinetics of viral pathogens. Currently, such models have received widespread attention in the study of SARS-CoV-2 causing the COVID-19 pandemic. Applicable to a large set of organoid models and viruses, we provide a step-by-step work instruction for the infection of human alveolar-like organoids with SARS-CoV-2 in this protocol collection. We also prepared a detailed description on state-of-the-art methodologies to assess the infection impact and the analysis of relevant host factors in organoids. This protocol collection consists of five different sets of protocols. Set 1 describes the protein extraction from human alveolar-like organoids and the determination of protein expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and FURIN as exemplary host factors of SARS-CoV-2. Set 2 provides detailed guidance on the extraction of RNA from human alveolar-like organoids and the subsequent qPCR to quantify the expression level of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN as host factors of SARS-CoV-2 on the mRNA level. Protocol set 3 contains an in-depth explanation on how to infect human alveolar-like organoids with SARS-CoV-2 and how to quantify the viral replication by plaque assay and viral E gene-based RT-qPCR. Set 4 provides a step-by-step protocol for the isolation of single cells from infected human alveolar-like organoids for further processing in single-cell RNA sequencing or flow cytometry. Set 5 presents a detailed protocol on how to perform the fixation of human alveolar-like organoids and guides through all steps of immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization to visualize SARS-CoV-2 and its host factors. The infection and all subsequent analytical methods have been successfully validated by biological replications with human alveolar-like organoids based on material from different donors.},

More than 250 αβT-cell clonotypes were tracked from donor to recipient. These clonotypes consisted almost exclusively of CD8+ effector memory T cells (CD8TEM), which exhibited a different transcriptional signature with enhanced effector and cytotoxic functions compared to other CD8TEM. Importantly, these distinct and persisting clonotypes could already be delineated in the donor. We confirmed these phenotypes on the protein level and their potential for selection from the graft. Thus, we identified a transcriptional signature associated with persistence and expansion of donor T-cell clonotypes after alloHSCT that may be exploited for personalized graft manipulation strategies in future studies.},

The ability to analyse transcriptomes of multiple heterogeneous cell types in parallel is especially valuable for cell-focused lung research where a variety of resident and recruited cells are essential for maintaining organ functionality. We compared the single-cell transcriptomes from publicly available and unpublished datasets of the lungs in six different species: human (Homo sapiens), African green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus), pig (Sus domesticus), hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), rat (Rattus norvegicus) and mouse (Mus musculus) by employing RNA velocity and intercellular communication based on ligand-receptor co-expression, among other techniques. Specifically, we demonstrated a workflow for interspecies data integration, applied a single unified gene nomenclature, performed cell-specific clustering and identified marker genes for each species. Overall, integrative approaches combining newly sequenced as well as publicly available datasets could help identify species-specific transcriptomic signatures in both healthy and diseased lung tissue and select appropriate models for future respiratory research.The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data.

A better understanding of the molecular regulation in tissue and cells upon IAV infection is needed to thoroughly understand pathogenesis. We analyzed IAV replication and gene expression induced by IAV strain H3N2 Panama in isolated primary human alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECIIs), the permanent A549 adenocarcinoma cell line, alveolar macrophages (AMs) and explanted human lung tissue by bulk RNA sequencing. Primary AECII exhibit in comparison to AM a broad set of strongly induced genes related to RIG-I and interferon (IFN) signaling. The response of AECII was partly mirrored in A549 cells. In human lung tissue, we observed induction of genes unlike in isolated cells. Viral RNA was used to correlate host cell gene expression changes with viral burden. While relative induction of key genes was similar, gene abundance was highest in AECII cells and AM, while weaker in the human lung (due to less IAV replication) and A549 cells (pointing to their limited suitability as a model). Correlation of host gene induction with viral burden allows a better understanding of the cell-type specific induction of pathways and a possible role of cellular crosstalk requiring intact tissue.},

Here, we describe gradual interferon-α/interferon-β (IFNα/β)-induced transcriptional adaptations that endow APCs with the capacity to rapidly activate the transcriptional regulators p65, IRF1 and FOS after CD4+ T cell-mediated CD40 stimulation. While these responses operate through broadly used signaling components, they induce a unique set of co-stimulatory molecules and soluble mediators that cannot be elicited by IFN$\alpha$/$\beta$ or CD40 alone. These responses are critical for the acquisition of antiviral CD8+ T cell effector function, and their activity in APCs from individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 correlates with milder disease. These observations uncover a sequential integration process whereby APCs rely on CD4+ T cells to select the innate circuits that guide antiviral CD8+ T cell responses.},

  abstract = {For cells to perform their biological functions, they need to adopt specific shapes and form functionally distinct subcellular compartments. This is achieved in part via an asymmetric distribution of mRNAs within cells. Currently, the main model of mRNA localization involves specific sequences called “zipcodes” that direct mRNAs to their proper locations. However, while thousands of mRNAs localize within cells, only a few zipcodes have been identified, suggesting that additional mechanisms contribute to localization. Here, we assess the role of mRNA stability in localization by combining the isolation of the soma and neurites of mouse primary cortical and mESC-derived neurons, SLAM-seq, m6A-RIP-seq, the perturbation of mRNA destabilization mechanisms, and the analysis of multiple mRNA localization datasets. We show that depletion of mRNA destabilization elements, such as m6A, AU-rich elements, and suboptimal codons, functions as a mechanism that mediates the localization of mRNAs associated with housekeeping functions to neurites in several types of neurons.},

HL7’s Genomics Reporting Implementation Guide (IG) was adopted as a basis for the FHIR® specification which was subjected to a public ballot. In addition, elements in the MolGen dataset were mapped to the fields defined in ISO/TS 20428:2017 standard to evaluate compliance.A core dataset of 76 data elements, clustered into 6 categories was created to represent all key information of German MolGen reports. Based on this, a FHIR specification with 16 profiles, 14 derived from HL7®’s Genomics Reporting IG and 2 additional profiles (of the FamilyMemberHistory and RiskAssessment resources), was developed. Five example resource bundles show how our adaptation of an international standard can be used to model MolGen report data that was requested following oncological or rare disease indications. Furthermore, the map of the MolGen report data elements to the fields defined by the ISO/TC 20428:2017 standard, confirmed the presence of the majority of required fields.Our report serves as a template for other research initiatives attempting to create a standard format for unstructured genomic report data. Use of standard formats facilitates integration of genomic data into electronic health records for clinical decision support.}},

  abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM), a tumor of germinal center (GC)-experienced plasma cells, comprises distinct genetic subgroups, such as the t(11;14)/CCND1 and the t(4;14)/MMSET subtype. We have generated genetically defined, subgroup-specific MM models by the GC B cell-specific coactivation of mouse Ccnd1 or MMSET with a constitutively active Ikk2 mutant, mimicking the secondary NF-κB activation frequently seen in human MM. Ccnd1/Ikk2ca and MMSET/Ikk2ca mice developed a pronounced, clonally restricted plasma cell outgrowth with age, accompanied by serum M spikes, bone marrow insufficiency, and bone lesions. The transgenic plasma cells could be propagated in vivo and showed distinct transcriptional profiles, resembling their human MM counterparts. Thus, we show that targeting the expression of genes involved in MM subgroup-specific chromosomal translocations into mouse GC B cells translates into distinct MM-like diseases that recapitulate key features of the human tumors, opening the way to a better understanding of the pathogenesis and therapeutic vulnerabilities of different MM subgroups.},

Severe COVID-19 is linked to both dysfunctional immune response and unrestrained immunopathology, and it remains unclear whether T cells contribute to disease pathology. Here, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and single-cell proteomics with mechanistic studies to assess pathogenic T cell functions and inducing signals. We identified highly activated CD16+ T cells with increased cytotoxic functions in severe COVID-19. CD16 expression enabled immune-complex-mediated, T cell receptor-independent degranulation and cytotoxicity not found in other diseases. CD16+ T cells from COVID-19 patients promoted microvascular endothelial cell injury and release of neutrophil and monocyte chemoattractants. CD16+ T cell clones persisted beyond acute disease maintaining their cytotoxic phenotype. Increased generation of C3a in severe COVID-19 induced activated CD16+ cytotoxic T cells. Proportions of activated CD16+ T cells and plasma levels of complement proteins upstream of C3a were associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, supporting a pathological role of exacerbated cytotoxicity and complement activation in COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Prolonged lung pathology has been associated with COVID-19, yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind this chronic inflammatory disease are poorly understood. In this study, we combine advanced imaging and spatial transcriptomics to shed light on the local immune response in severe COVID-19. We show that activated adventitial niches are crucial microenvironments contributing to the orchestration of prolonged lung immunopathology. Up-regulation of the chemokines CCL21 and CCL18 associates to endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and tissue fibrosis within these niches. CCL21 over-expression additionally links to the local accumulation of T cells expressing the cognate receptor CCR7. These T cells are imprinted with an exhausted phenotype and form lymphoid aggregates that can organize in ectopic lymphoid structures. Our work proposes immune-stromal interaction mechanisms promoting a self-sustained and non-resolving local immune response that extends beyond active viral infection and perpetuates tissue remodeling.},

  abstract = {Class II histone deacetylases (HDAC) orchestrate T cell-dependent immune responses via the epigenetic control of genes and via the post-translational modification of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. However, the contribution of single HDAC family members to the differentiation and function of peripheral CD8+ T cells remains elusive. We here demonstrate that HDAC7-deficiency leads to the upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules, decreased calcium influx as well as increased apoptosis of peripheral murine CD8+ T cells, which we could link to a MEF2D-dependent induction of FasL expression ultimately deterring the survival of HDAC7-deficient CD8+ T cells. Likewise, we observed in mouse models of lymphoma, that mice with a T cell specific-deletion of Hdac7 harbor impaired anti-tumor immune responses in syngeneic transfer models of lymphoma and we found that HDAC7 is required for CD8+ T cell-dependent memory recall responses in models of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. Taken together, we identify HDAC7 as a central regulator of cellular exhaustion and apoptosis of peripheral CD8+ T cells, controlling CD8+ T cell dependent anti-tumor and anti-viral immunity in mice.Significance Although HDAC7 was identified as an important regulator of thymocyte development and survival, its role in the homeostasis and the functions of adult CD8+ T cells is not fully understood. Here, we identify HDAC7 as a critical regulator of peripheral CD8+ T cells since its deletion impairs anti-tumor and anti-viral immune responses in mouse models of LCMV infection and transfer models of lymphoma. We attribute this phenotype to impaired survival, calcium homeostasis as well as deterred memory function and increased exhaustion of HDAC7-deficient CD8+ T cells. Our findings are of clinical relevance regarding potential immune suppressive side effects of HDAC inhibitors that are currently under clinical trials for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancers.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a syndrome characterized by accumulation of surfactant lipoproteins within the lung alveoli. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are crucial for surfactant clearance, and their differentiation depends on colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2), which regulates the establishment of an AM-characteristic gene regulatory network. Here, we report that the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) is essential for the development of the AM identity, as demonstrated by transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis. Furthermore, C/EBPβ-deficient AMs showed severe defects in proliferation, phagocytosis, and lipid metabolism, collectively resulting in a PAP-like syndrome. Mechanistically, the long C/EBPβ protein variants LAP* and LAP together with CSF2 signaling induced the expression of Pparg isoform 2 but not Pparg isoform 1, a molecular regulatory mechanism that was also observed in other CSF2-primed macrophages. These results uncover C/EBPβ as a key regulator of AM cell fate and shed light on the molecular networks controlling lipid metabolism in macrophages. The molecular network of surfactant lipid metabolism in alveolar macrophages is orchestrated by the transcription factor C/EBPβ. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are specialized macrophages that serve several key functions in the lung. Here, Dörr et&nbsp;al. used transcriptomic, ChIPmentation, and chromatin accessibility analysis to demonstrate that the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) is required for AM development. C/EBPβ-deficient AMs had defects in proliferation, lipid metabolism, and phagocytosis, thus causing mice to have symptoms that resemble pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). They observed that the long C/EBPβ protein variants LAP* and LAP, combined with CSF2 signaling, induced specific expression of Pparg isoform 2, which is a mechanism that they also observed in other CSF2-primed macrophages. These findings indicate that C/EBPβ is a key regulator of AM development and lipid metabolism.},

  abstract = {The placenta is a temporary organ with a unique structure and function to ensure healthy fetal development. Placental dysfunction is involved in pre-eclampsia (PE), fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). A diabetic state affects maternal and fetal health and may lead to functional alterations of placental metabolism, inflammation, hypoxia, and weight, amplifying the fetal stress. The placental molecular adaptations to the diabetic environment and the adaptive spatio–temporal consequences to elevated glucose or insulin are largely unknown (2). We aimed to identify gene expression signatures related to the diabetic placental pathology of placentas from women with diabetes mellitus. Human placenta samples (n = 77) consisting of healthy controls, women with either gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and women with GDM, type 1 or type 2 diabetes and superimposed PE were collected. Interestingly, gene expression differences quantified by total RNA sequencing were mainly driven by fetal sex rather than clinical diagnosis. Association of the principal components with a full set of clinical patient data identified fetal sex as the single main explanatory variable. Accordingly, placentas complicated by type 1 and type 2 diabetes showed only few differentially expressed genes, while possible effects of GDM and diabetic pregnancy complicated by PE were not identifiable in this cohort. We conclude that fetal sex has a prominent effect on the placental transcriptome, dominating and confounding gene expression signatures resulting from diabetes mellitus in settings of well-controlled diabetic disease. Our results support the notion of placenta as a sexual dimorphic organ.},

Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of the HTII-280+/EpCAM+ population from adult human lung revealed subclusters enriched for adult stem cell signature (ASCS) genes. We found that alveolar progenitors in organoid culture in vitro show phenotypic lineage plasticity as they can yield alveolar or bronchial cell-type progeny. The direction of the differentiation is dependent on the presence of the GSK-3$\beta$ inhibitor, CHIR99021. By RNA-seq profiling of GSK-3$\beta$ knockdown organoids we identified additional candidate target genes of the inhibitor, among others FOXM1 and EGF. This gives evidence of Wnt pathway independent regulatory mechanisms of alveolar specification. Following influenza A virus (IAV) infection organoids showed a similar response as lung tissue explants which confirms their suitability for studies of sequelae of pathogen-host interaction.},

@Article{rieke2022feasibility,
  abstract = {Background: Structured and harmonized implementation of molecular tumor boards (MTB) for the clinical interpretation of molecular data presents a current challenge for precision oncology. Heterogeneity in the interpretation of molecular data was shown for patients even with a limited number of molecular alterations. Integration of high-dimensional molecular data, including RNA- (RNA-Seq) and whole-exome sequencing (WES), is expected to further complicate clinical application. To analyze challenges for MTB harmonization based on complex molecular datasets, we retrospectively compared clinical interpretation of WES and RNA-Seq data by two independent molecular tumor boards. Methods: High-dimensional molecular cancer profiling including WES and RNA-Seq was performed for patients with advanced solid tumors, no available standard therapy, ECOG performance status of 0–1, and available fresh-frozen tissue within the DKTK-MASTER Program from 2016 to 2018. Identical molecular profiling data of 40 patients were independently discussed by two molecular tumor boards (MTB) after prior annotation by specialized physicians, following independent, but similar workflows. Identified biomarkers and resulting treatment options were compared between the MTBs and patients were followed up clinically. Results: A median of 309 molecular aberrations from WES and RNA-Seq (n = 38) and 82 molecular aberrations from WES only (n = 3) were considered for clinical interpretation for 40 patients (one patient sequenced twice). A median of 3 and 2 targeted treatment options were identified per patient, respectively. Most treatment options were identified for receptor tyrosine kinase, PARP, and mTOR inhibitors, as well as immunotherapy. The mean overlap coefficient between both MTB was 66%. Highest agreement rates were observed with the interpretation of single nucleotide variants, clinical evidence levels 1 and 2, and monotherapy whereas the interpretation of gene expression changes, preclinical evidence levels 3 and 4, and combination therapy yielded lower agreement rates. Patients receiving treatment following concordant MTB recommendations had significantly longer overall survival than patients receiving treatment following discrepant recommendations or physician’s choice. Conclusions: Reproducible clinical interpretation of high-dimensional molecular data is feasible and agreement rates are encouraging, when compared to previous reports. The interpretation of molecular aberrations beyond single nucleotide variants and preclinically validated biomarkers as well as combination therapies were identified as additional difficulties for ongoing harmonization efforts.},

  abstract = { 3082Background: KEAP1 and STK11 mutations are associated with resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Mechanisms are currently unknown. Methods: We examined mutation, methylation, copy number and gene expression data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and cervical carcinoma (CESC) data sets as well as public single cell gene expression data from a HNSCC cohort. Pathway annotations were performed using gene set enrichment analysis. A previously published cohort of NSCLC patients treated with ICI was analyzed for the predictive value of NFE2L2 mutations on PFS. Results: Annotation of STK11 and KEAP1 mutant LUAD revealed identical gene set enrichment for mitochondrial metabolism and downregulation of the STING-pathway, immune checkpoints, and interferon signaling. A STK11/KEAP1-mutation derived gene expression signature was established in LUAD and found to be driven by NFE2L2-regulated genes. This gene expression signature was independently predictive of immune desertion in LSCC, CESC and HNSCC and associated with STING-pathway downregulation in single cell sequencing analyses in HNSCC. KEAP1 and STK11 mutations were less frequent in LSCC, CESC and HNSCC but NFE2L2 mutations were identified in 15, 6 and 5\%, respectively. NFE2L2 mutant SCC exhibited upregulation of the 15-gene- signature as well as immune desertion. In NSCLC, NFE2L2 mutations were associated with significantly worse PFS with ICI. Conclusions: Alterations of KEAP1, STK11, NFE2L2 and other related genes are linked to NFE2L2 target gene upregulation and immune desertion in LUAD, CESC, LSCC and HNSCC alike. The NFE2L2 pathway should be investigated clinically as a putative negative predictive biomarker for ICI and a potential therapeutic target. },

  abstract = { e13033Background: Panel sequencing (PS) has become a standard-of-care in cancer diagnostics. More comprehensive analyses such as whole-exome (WES) or RNA sequencing (RNAseq) allow for the detection of rare and unknown genetic aberrations that are not covered by predefined assays. The clinical impact of targeted versus comprehensive genomic assays were analyzed in patients presented at the Charité Molecular Tumor Board (MTB). Methods: Patients (pts) with advanced and/or metastatic cancer for whom no standard therapy was available were discussed in the MTB to allocate diagnostic profiling and guide biomarker-based treatment (BBT). Pts had to be < 50 years of age or diagnosed with a rare tumor entity to undergo WES/RNAseq, performed on fresh tissue. If ineligible, standard PS was performed on archival tissue. BBT recommendations, ranked by pre-specified evidence levels, were made by the MTB and pts were followed up. Results: 228 patients (median age 49 years, 108 female and 120 male) were discussed in the MTB between January 2016 and February 2019. We assigned 73 and 155 pts to PS and WES/RNAseq and results were obtained for 78.1\% (n = 57/73) and 54.8\% (n = 85/155) pts, respectively. Sequencing failed for 11 (PS; 15.1\%) and 62 (WES/RNAseq; 40\%) pts, most commonly due to insufficient tissue (n = 29). Sequencing was ongoing in 5 (PS) and 8 (WES/RNAseq) pts at the time of analysis. A median of 2 BBTs were recommended for 75.4\% (43/57) of PS (range r: 1-3) and 90.6\% (77/85) of WES/RNAseq pts (r: 1-6) each. 22\% (n = 17/77) of WES/RNAseq pts had ≥4 BBTs made by the MTB. Treatment was initiated in 30.2\% (n = 13/43) of PS and 40.2\% (n = 31/77) of WES/RNAseq pts. Clinical benefit rates (CBRs) were 23.1\% (2 PR, 1 SD) for PS and 45.2\% (2 CR, 3 PR, 9 SD) for WES/RNAseq pts. Overall survival data was immature at the time of analysis. Conclusions: Utilizing WES/RNAseq is a feasible approach to perform tumor profiling in a heterogeneous cohort. We here show a higher rate of pts receiving confident evidence-based treatment recommendations in the WES/RNAseq group and a higher rate of treatment initiation. The CBR nearly doubled in the WES/RNAseq cohort when compared to standard PS pts, thus emphasizing the need for larger comparative analyses to guide diagnostic decision-making. },

  abstract = { e24164Background: Precision Oncology programs hold promise to improve the treatment of cancer patients. The interpretation and prioritization of complex molecular data from comprehensive analyses has not been standardized. We implemented a knowledge-warehouse-based workflow for sequence data interpretation and treatment recommendations in our molecular tumor board (MTB) and report here the experience in 125 patients. Methods: An interdisciplinary MTB comprising of medical oncology, pathology, bioinformatics and molecular biology was initiated. Molecular analyses including Whole-Exome (WES), targeted and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) were performed within research programs, in clinical routine and by external providers for patients with advanced tumors after standard therapy. A workflow was established for the interpretation of identified aberrations incorporating manual curation, annotation and prioritization based on evidence levels, knowledge databases, IHC validation, in-vivo, in-vitro and in-silico models and interdisciplinary discussions. Results: 125 patients with disease refractory to standard treatments and available molecular analysis of their tumor were discussed in the Charité MTB between 2016 and 2018. WES and RNASeq data were available for 96 patients and panel sequencing for 29. The most common tumor types were melanoma (55), neuroendocrine (33) and colorectal neoplasias (13). All identified aberrations were annotated using prespecified evidence levels with data from a flexible data warehouse and then ranked by the MTB. Recommendations were made for 114 patients with a median number of 2 (range 1-8) recommendations per patient. Most frequent recommendations were MEK, MET, mTOR and PARP-inhibitors. At the time of analyses, 49 patients had started an experimental therapy based on the recommendations. Best responses, as documented, were CR (1), PR (8), MR (3) and SD (7) with missing response data for another N = 7 patients. Conclusions: Implementation of a structured workflow allows for an effective translation of complex molecular data, including WES and RNASeq, into clinical application. },

  abstract = { e14613Background: Immune checkpoints are an emerging treatment target in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Expression of PD-L1 and an IFNG immune signature have been shown as biomarkers of response. In this study we analyzed mutational signatures to identify recurrent mutational patterns associated with inflammation. Methods: HNSCC mutation and gene expression data were downloaded (n = 496, TCGA). Inflamed tumors were identified through upregulation of a predefined 6-gene IFNG immune signature. Mutational load, base exchange motifs and a BRCAness signature were analyzed in inflamed and non-inflamed tumors. Results were validated in independent datasets of cervical, urothelial and lung cancer (TCGA). Results: Total mutational load did not correlate with tumor inflammation (r = -0.03, p = 0.5). An APOBEC-associated tCw (thymine – cytosine – adenine/thymine) mutational signature was significantly associated with inflammation (r = 0.26, p = 2.923e-09). The tCw signature was furthermore correlated with the expression of PD-L1 and other immune checkpoints (r = 0.19, p = 1.723e-05). The TCW mutational signature correlated with the expression of APOBEC3 genes. Expression of APOBEC3 genes also correlated with tumor inflammation (r = 0.62, p < 2.2e-16). As a second mutational signature, indels and an independent BRCAness signature were significantly enriched in non-inflamed tumors (p = 6.464e-14). Enrichment of an APOBEC mutational signature in inflamed tumors could be validated in cervical and urothelial carcinoma but not NSCLC. Conclusions: In HNSCC, overall mutational load is not associated with inflammation. BRCAness is significantly associated with immune-desertion whereas expression of APOBEC genes and an APOBEC mutational signature significantly correlates with the expression of PD-L1 and a T-cell inflamed signature. These findings suggest that a specific mutational pattern might serve as a biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibition in cancer. },
