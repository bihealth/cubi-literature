abstract = {Post-acute lung sequelae of COVID-19 are challenging many survivors across the world, yet the mechanisms behind are poorly understood. Our results delineate an inflammatory cascade of events occurring along disease progression within fibrovascular niches. It is initiated by endothelial dysfunction, followed by heme scavenging of CD163+ macrophages and production of CCL18. This chemokine synergizes with local CCL21 upregulation to influence the stromal composition favoring endothelial to mesenchymal transition. The local immune response is further modulated via recruitment of CCR7+ T cells into the expanding fibrovascular niche and imprinting an exhausted, T follicular helper{\textendash}like phenotype in these cells. Eventually, this culminates in the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures, further perpetuating chronic inflammation. Thus, our work presents misdirected immune-stromal interaction mechanisms promoting a self-sustained and non-resolving local immune response that extends beyond active viral infection and leads to profound tissue repurposing and chronic inflammation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by funding from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, HA5354/10-1, SPP1937 (HA5354/8-2) and TRR130 P17 to A.E.H., TRR 130 C01 and SFB 1444 P14 (to A.E.H. and R.N.).

abstract = {Class II histone deacetylases (HDAC) orchestrate T cell-dependent immune responses via the epigenetic control of genes and via the post-translational modification of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. However, the contribution of single HDAC family members to the differentiation and function of peripheral CD8+ T cells remains elusive. We here demonstrate that HDAC7-deficiency leads to the upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules, decreased calcium influx as well as increased apoptosis of peripheral murine CD8+ T cells, which we could link to a MEF2D-dependent induction of FasL expression ultimately deterring the survival of HDAC7-deficient CD8+ T cells. Likewise, we observed in mouse models of lymphoma, that mice with a T cell specific-deletion of Hdac7 harbor impaired anti-tumor immune responses in syngeneic transfer models of lymphoma and we found that HDAC7 is required for CD8+ T cell-dependent memory recall responses in models of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. Taken together, we identify HDAC7 as a central regulator of cellular exhaustion and apoptosis of peripheral CD8+ T cells, controlling CD8+ T cell dependent anti-tumor and anti-viral immunity in mice.Significance Although HDAC7 was identified as an important regulator of thymocyte development and survival, its role in the homeostasis and the functions of adult CD8+ T cells is not fully understood. Here, we identify HDAC7 as a critical regulator of peripheral CD8+ T cells since its deletion impairs anti-tumor and anti-viral immune responses in mouse models of LCMV infection and transfer models of lymphoma. We attribute this phenotype to impaired survival, calcium homeostasis as well as deterred memory function and increased exhaustion of HDAC7-deficient CD8+ T cells. Our findings are of clinical relevance regarding potential immune suppressive side effects of HDAC inhibitors that are currently under clinical trials for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancers.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Severe COVID-19 is linked to both dysfunctional immune response and unrestrained immunopathology, and it remains unclear whether T cells contribute to disease pathology. Here, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and single-cell proteomics with mechanistic studies to assess pathogenic T cell functions and inducing signals. We identified highly activated CD16+ T cells with increased cytotoxic functions in severe COVID-19. CD16 expression enabled immune-complex-mediated, T cell receptor-independent degranulation and cytotoxicity not found in other diseases. CD16+ T cells from COVID-19 patients promoted microvascular endothelial cell injury and release of neutrophil and monocyte chemoattractants. CD16+ T cell clones persisted beyond acute disease maintaining their cytotoxic phenotype. Increased generation of C3a in severe COVID-19 induced activated CD16+ cytotoxic T cells. Proportions of activated CD16+ T cells and plasma levels of complement proteins upstream of C3a were associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, supporting a pathological role of exacerbated cytotoxicity and complement activation in COVID-19.}

abstract = {Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a syndrome characterized by accumulation of surfactant lipoproteins within the lung alveoli. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are crucial for surfactant clearance, and their differentiation depends on colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2), which regulates the establishment of an AM-characteristic gene regulatory network. Here, we report that the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) is essential for the development of the AM identity, as demonstrated by transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis. Furthermore, C/EBPβ-deficient AMs showed severe defects in proliferation, phagocytosis, and lipid metabolism, collectively resulting in a PAP-like syndrome. Mechanistically, the long C/EBPβ protein variants LAP* and LAP together with CSF2 signaling induced the expression of Pparg isoform 2 but not Pparg isoform 1, a molecular regulatory mechanism that was also observed in other CSF2-primed macrophages. These results uncover C/EBPβ as a key regulator of AM cell fate and shed light on the molecular networks controlling lipid metabolism in macrophages. The molecular network of surfactant lipid metabolism in alveolar macrophages is orchestrated by the transcription factor C/EBPβ. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are specialized macrophages that serve several key functions in the lung. Here, Dörr et&nbsp;al. used transcriptomic, ChIPmentation, and chromatin accessibility analysis to demonstrate that the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) is required for AM development. C/EBPβ-deficient AMs had defects in proliferation, lipid metabolism, and phagocytosis, thus causing mice to have symptoms that resemble pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). They observed that the long C/EBPβ protein variants LAP* and LAP, combined with CSF2 signaling, induced specific expression of Pparg isoform 2, which is a mechanism that they also observed in other CSF2-primed macrophages. These findings indicate that C/EBPβ is a key regulator of AM development and lipid metabolism.}}

ABSTRACT = {The placenta is a temporary organ with a unique structure and function to ensure healthy fetal development. Placental dysfunction is involved in pre-eclampsia (PE), fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). A diabetic state affects maternal and fetal health and may lead to functional alterations of placental metabolism, inflammation, hypoxia, and weight, amplifying the fetal stress. The placental molecular adaptations to the diabetic environment and the adaptive spatio–temporal consequences to elevated glucose or insulin are largely unknown (2). We aimed to identify gene expression signatures related to the diabetic placental pathology of placentas from women with diabetes mellitus. Human placenta samples (n = 77) consisting of healthy controls, women with either gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and women with GDM, type 1 or type 2 diabetes and superimposed PE were collected. Interestingly, gene expression differences quantified by total RNA sequencing were mainly driven by fetal sex rather than clinical diagnosis. Association of the principal components with a full set of clinical patient data identified fetal sex as the single main explanatory variable. Accordingly, placentas complicated by type 1 and type 2 diabetes showed only few differentially expressed genes, while possible effects of GDM and diabetic pregnancy complicated by PE were not identifiable in this cohort. We conclude that fetal sex has a prominent effect on the placental transcriptome, dominating and confounding gene expression signatures resulting from diabetes mellitus in settings of well-controlled diabetic disease. Our results support the notion of placenta as a sexual dimorphic organ.},

abstract={Mechanisms of epithelial renewal in the alveolar compartment remain incompletely understood. To this end, we aimed to characterize alveolar progenitors. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of the HTII-280+/EpCAM+ population from adult human lung revealed subclusters enriched for adult stem cell signature (ASCS) genes. We found that alveolar progenitors in organoid culture in vitro show phenotypic lineage plasticity as they can yield alveolar or bronchial cell-type progeny. The direction of the differentiation is dependent on the presence of the GSK-3$\beta$ inhibitor, CHIR99021. By RNA-seq profiling of GSK-3$\beta$ knockdown organoids we identified additional candidate target genes of the inhibitor, among others FOXM1 and EGF. This gives evidence of Wnt pathway independent regulatory mechanisms of alveolar specification. Following influenza A virus (IAV) infection organoids showed a similar response as lung tissue explants which confirms their suitability for studies of sequelae of pathogen-host interaction.},

abstract = {Background: Structured and harmonized implementation of molecular tumor boards (MTB) for the clinical interpretation of molecular data presents a current challenge for precision oncology. Heterogeneity in the interpretation of molecular data was shown for patients even with a limited number of molecular alterations. Integration of high-dimensional molecular data, including RNA- (RNA-Seq) and whole-exome sequencing (WES), is expected to further complicate clinical application. To analyze challenges for MTB harmonization based on complex molecular datasets, we retrospectively compared clinical interpretation of WES and RNA-Seq data by two independent molecular tumor boards. Methods: High-dimensional molecular cancer profiling including WES and RNA-Seq was performed for patients with advanced solid tumors, no available standard therapy, ECOG performance status of 0–1, and available fresh-frozen tissue within the DKTK-MASTER Program from 2016 to 2018. Identical molecular profiling data of 40 patients were independently discussed by two molecular tumor boards (MTB) after prior annotation by specialized physicians, following independent, but similar workflows. Identified biomarkers and resulting treatment options were compared between the MTBs and patients were followed up clinically. Results: A median of 309 molecular aberrations from WES and RNA-Seq (n = 38) and 82 molecular aberrations from WES only (n = 3) were considered for clinical interpretation for 40 patients (one patient sequenced twice). A median of 3 and 2 targeted treatment options were identified per patient, respectively. Most treatment options were identified for receptor tyrosine kinase, PARP, and mTOR inhibitors, as well as immunotherapy. The mean overlap coefficient between both MTB was 66%. Highest agreement rates were observed with the interpretation of single nucleotide variants, clinical evidence levels 1 and 2, and monotherapy whereas the interpretation of gene expression changes, preclinical evidence levels 3 and 4, and combination therapy yielded lower agreement rates. Patients receiving treatment following concordant MTB recommendations had significantly longer overall survival than patients receiving treatment following discrepant recommendations or physician’s choice. Conclusions: Reproducible clinical interpretation of high-dimensional molecular data is feasible and agreement rates are encouraging, when compared to previous reports. The interpretation of molecular aberrations beyond single nucleotide variants and preclinically validated biomarkers as well as combination therapies were identified as additional difficulties for ongoing harmonization efforts.},
